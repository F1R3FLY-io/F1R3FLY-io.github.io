description: The issue of developing a more formal account of service descriptions and service contracts with a mobile process algebra, is discussed. Descriptions based on behavioral types can form the basis of a new kind of discovery mechanism, specifically one based on partial behavioral descriptions. This mechanism depends on the computation of compatibility of types being a terminating computation. HIgher level services, like the reputation services analogous to business rating services like Dun and Bradstreet, will be needed to guarantee end-to-end quality of service. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/944217.944236">Full article.</a>
