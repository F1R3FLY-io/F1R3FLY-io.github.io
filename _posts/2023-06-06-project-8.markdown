description: In Meredith and Radestock's paper on the rho-calculus it was observed that a theory like the Ï€-calculus, dependent on a theory of names, can be closed, through a mechanism of quoting, so that (quoted) processes provide the necessary notion of names. Here we expand on this theme by examining a construction for a Hennessy-Milner logic corresponding to an asynchronous message-passing calculus built on a notion of quoting. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11580850_19">Full article.</a>
